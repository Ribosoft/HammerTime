~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Filtered output for siRNAs with disruption energy~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Column 1: starting target position
Column 2: ending target position
Column 3: sense siRNA (5p --> 3p)
Column 4: antisense siRNA (5p --> 3p)
Column 5: siRNA GC content
Column 6: differential stability of siRNA duplex ends (DSSE, in kcal/mol)
Column 7: average unpaired probability for target site nucleotides
Column 8: binding site disruption energy (kcal/mol)

FILTER CRITERIA: ("<=": less than or equal to)
                 (">=": greater than or equal to)
                 ( ">": greater than)

 A) 30% <= GC % <= 70%;
 B) Exclusion of target sequence with at least one of AAAA,
    CCCC, GGGG, or UUUU;
 C) DSSE > -1 kcal/mol (asymmetry rule);
 D) Average unpaired probability for target site nucleotides >= 0.5;
 E) For each peak in the accessibility profile that is above the threshold
    probability of 0.5, all sites targeted to this same peak are
    ranked by their average unpaired probability (the higher the better) and
    at most n sites are selected for each peak, where n is determined by
    max([width of peak/site length], 2);
 F) Among sites satisfying criteria A-E, the top 20 unique ones with
    the highest average unpaired probability are listed.

NOTE:
 i) The average unpaired probability is used in filter criteria D, E and F to
    cut down the number of reported sites in order to make the disruption
    energy calculation manageable on our web servers.
