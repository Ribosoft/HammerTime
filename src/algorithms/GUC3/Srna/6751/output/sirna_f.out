Column 8: average internal stability at the cleavage site                                                                   (AIS, in kcal/mol)

FILTER CRITERIA: ("<=": less than or equal to)

 A) Antisense siRNA binding energy <= -10 kcal/mol                                                                         (target accessibility rule);
 B) Duplex feature score of 6 or higher; 
 C) DSSE > 0 kcal/mol (asymmetry rule); 
 D) AIS > -8.6 kcal/mol (cleavage site instability rule); 
 E) 30% <= GC % <= 60%; 
 F) Exclusion of target sequence with at least one of AAAA,
    CCCC, GGGG, or UUUU.

NOTES:

 1) The starting (ending) position of the target sequence 
    corresponds to position 19 (1) of the antisense siRNA 
    (i.e., dinucleotide leader and nt 22 and nt 23 in 
    Tuschl patterns are not considered by us to be part 
    of the target sequence); 
 2) Sense siRNA=target sequence +3 prime dTdT overhang;
    dTdT for both sense and antisense siRNAs can be
    replaced by UU;
 3) GC %= GC count in siRNA (excluding overhangs)/19 x100%;
 4) DSSE = stability of 5p-antisense end of 4 base pairs 
          -stability of 5p-sense end of 4 base pairs; 
    the asymmetry rule is enforced by DSSE > 0.
    (see Schwartz et al. Cell, Vol. 115, 199-208, 2003). 
 5) AIS = average of internal stability values for  
    positions 9-14 of the antisense strand; starting at a 
    position, the internal stability is for 4 BP stacks;
    the rule of relative instability at the cleavage site
    is enforced by AIS > -8.6 kcal/mol, the midpoint 
    between the minimum of -3.6 and the maximum of -13.6. 
    (see Khvorova et al. Cell, Vol. 115, 209-216, 2003). 
 6) Total siRNA duplex score is the sum of target 
    accessibility score, duplex feature score and
    duplex thermodynamics score, with a maximum of                                                                         20 points;
    the accessibility score is based on antisense
    siRNA binding energy and has a range of [0, 8];
    the duplex feature score is computed with the
    algorithm by Reynolds et al. (Nature Biotech.,
    Vol. 22, 326-330, 2004), and has a range of [-2, 10];
    the duplex thermodynamics score has a range of  
    [0, 2], with contribution of 1 point for DSSE > 0, 
    and 1 point for AIS > -8.6 kcal/mol.
