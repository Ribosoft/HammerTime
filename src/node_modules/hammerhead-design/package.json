These were developed as part of the Ribosoft project, a webservice and HTTP API for designing hammerhead ribozymes.\n\n##How it works##\nMore details soon.\n\n##Installation##\n###Github###\n\n    $ git clone git://git@github.com:anas-ambri/node-hammerhead-design.git\n    $ cd node-hammerhead-design\n\t\n\n###NPM###\nOne can alternatively just use `npm`:\n\n    $ npm install hammerhead-design\n\n##Configuration##\n###Dependencies###\nThis library relies on the following executables:\n\n- [sFold](http://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgi-bin/index.pl): Software for Statistical Folding of Nucleic Acids and Studies of Regulatory RNAs. This was developed at the Wadsworth Center, NYS Department of Health. More details on licensing sFold can be found [here](http://sfold.wadsworth.org/SFOLD-EXE-ACADEMIC.html)\n- [UNAFold](http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/): Unified Nucleic Acid Folding and hybridization package. This package was developed at the RNA institute, University at Albany.\n\nThese two executables need to be installed on your system. The path to the executables must be supplied in `config/config.json`.\n\n##Tests##\nThe command `npm test` will do.",
