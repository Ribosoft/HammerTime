How Important				      What		
Meh                             On the results page, show the sequence in triples and highlight cutsites
Kinda                           Highlight first character that should not be part of the sequence
Super                           Create results page with big table that displays cutsite+candidate# as id, other columns: cutsite, 6 fitnesses (floats)
Super                           Finish up all HTML pages, so we get to the tweaking		
Super                           Setup an error reporting system (including server-side errors)
Super                           Setup monit to track server state
Super                           Write API page with documentation
Super                           Write documentation for website and server setup            
Rather                          Clean up express APIs
Super                           Flush database for finished processes
Super                           Setup emailing process to send link to finished work
Super                           Setup nodeunit for unit tests
Super                           Setup mocha for BDD tests
Super                           Write unit tests
Super                           Write BDD tests
Kinda                           Annealing temperature for degenerate base-pairs BIG
Super                           Fold given constraints from user input DONE
Lil'                            Change UNA fold API to take user environmental constraints
Lil'                            Implement API to Blast    
Super                           Implement initial algorithm to test stuff     DONE
Meh                             The plasmid extra piece to add to help ppl
SUPER                           CONCURRENY / SPACE                            DONE
                                  Each candidate has to wait on the folding to execute file reading, to finish
                                  its cutsite, which then reports to its request
                                  there is a lot of async/re-sync 
Meh                             Implement Wishbone
Meh								The candidate generation no longer does addition of promoter. This is cause     DONE
									they are now cleansed right after of those with low Tm
									Thus promoter add must be moved after cleanse, but BEFORE fold
